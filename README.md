  Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 💬 **Chatbot Integration** | Uses **OpenRouter APIs** (ChatGPT, Gemini) for natural dialogue and context-based responses. |
| 📸 **Gesture-Based Photobooth** | Captures images when specific hand gestures are detected using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**. |
| 🌐 **Real-Time Translation** | Multi-language speech and text translation using **Google Translator APIs**. |
| 🎥 **Video Playback Module** | Displays promotional or informational videos through the GUI for event/advertisement purposes. |
| 🔊 **Text-to-Speech Welcome** | Converts text to speech (TTS) to greet and interact with guests dynamically. |
| 🧍‍♀️ **Face Recognition Attendance** | Detects and identifies students/employees, automatically marking attendance. |
| 😊 **Emotion Recognition** | Analyzes facial expressions in real time to gauge emotion and engagement level. |
| 📱 **Mobile Control via QR + Flask** | Integrated **Flask server** enables mobile connectivity — scanning a QR code from the robot’s GUI opens a control panel on mobile to operate robot functions remotely. |
